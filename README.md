## üëã Hey there!

I‚Äôm **Tayrine**, a Junior Full-Stack Developer who loves building apps that both work well and feel good to use.

I recently graduated from **Lighthouse Labs‚Äô Web Development program**, where I built full-stack projects using **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and more.  
I‚Äôm always learning and looking for new ways to level up my skills.

Before moving into tech, I worked in **civil engineering** and **hospitality**, gaining solid experience in problem-solving, managing projects and time, staying organized, and working well under pressure.

I‚Äôm excited to join a dev team where I can keep growing and contribute my skills.
