### 👋 Hey, I'm Tayrine! 

A Junior Full-Stack Developer who loves building apps that both work well and feel good to use.

I’m currently a **Full-Stack Developer Intern at [MyKitchenOps](https://www.mykitchenops.com/)**, working alongside senior engineers on a production application — refactoring code, fixing bugs, and improving features and UX using **React**, **Node.js**, **Supabase**, and **Tailwind**.

Before moving into tech, I worked in Civil Engineering and Hospitality, which shaped the structured, calm, and problem-solving mindset I bring into development today.
